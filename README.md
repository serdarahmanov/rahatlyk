## Features

- **Multi-language support** — Turkmen (`tm`), Russian (`ru`) and English (`en`) with a dropdown language switcher in the Navbar visible at all breakpoints.
- **Full-screen mobile menu** — frosted-glass overlay with large nav links, social icons (Instagram, email), and smooth open/close transitions.
- **Product Catalogue** — filterable grid with category tabs; individual product detail pages with image gallery (prev/next arrows appear only when a product has more than one photo).
- **News / Blog** — filterable by category (Company, Health, Products, Sustainability); featured article banner; individual article pages with sidebar and "More Articles" section. Homepage news section is a full-viewport auto-play infinite carousel.
- **Vacancies** — filterable by department; individual vacancy detail pages with rich job description, salary icon in the header, and "Other Openings" cards matching the main vacancies grid.
- **Contact & Vacancy forms** — custom JS validation with `noValidate`; per-field red ring + inline error messages; errors clear on field focus and auto-dismiss after 5 seconds; labeled fields with red asterisks for required; black submit button; in-flight submit locking to prevent duplicate requests; server-side email handling via `/api/contact` and `/api/vacancy` routes; sends a confirmation email to the user and a notification email with CV attachment to the company.
- **Apple-style vacancy cards** — department-coloured gradient header, coloured dot + department badge, salary with icon, two-line description, location pin; reused on vacancy detail recommendations with subtle lift + shadow on hover matching the `vacancy-cards-apple-v2` reference design.
- **Unified `FilterBar` component** — `src/components/FilterBar.tsx`; shared across Products, News, and Vacancies pages; mobile: horizontally scrollable pill strip with floating gradient arrow overlays (left/right); desktop: exposed via `forwardRef` for GSAP animations; grey pill palette (active: `bg-gray-900`, inactive: `border-gray-300 text-gray-500`).
- **Pagination** — all three listing pages (`/products`, `/news`, `/vacancies`) are paginated via a shared `Pagination` component (`src/components/Pagination.tsx`). Minimalist design: thin top border, muted count label (`1–9 of 27 articles`), prev/next arrow buttons, page numbers with ellipsis (active page underlined). Page changes scroll Lenis back to the top via a `scroll-to-top` custom DOM event, with a native fallback for `prefers-reduced-motion` users. Pagination state is synced to the URL (`?page=`, `?category=`, `?department=`) for deep-linking and browser back/forward support. The `PaginatedResult<T>` shape mirrors Payload CMS's `find()` response exactly for a future CMS swap.
- **Contact page two-column layout** — 65/35 split; left: heading + labeled contact form; right: sticky full-height panel reusing the about-page blob gradient (`about-mosaic-*` classes) with GSAP parallax scrub; contact info items (address, phone, email, hours) in solid white over the gradient.
- **URL-driven filtering** — all listing pages (`/products`, `/news`, `/vacancies`) read their active filter from query params (`?category=`, `?department=`) so category links from detail pages deep-link directly to the filtered view.
- **Payload CMS-ready data models** — `Article`, `Vacancy`, and `Product` interfaces use plain `string` for category/department (no union types), ISO date strings, and no derived/redundant fields, so they map 1-to-1 to Payload collections. `ProductCard` is derived via `Pick<Product, ...>` so listing pages carry only the fields they need. Locale-aware date formatting is centralised in `src/lib/formatDate.ts` using `Intl.DateTimeFormat`.
- **Multi-photo news articles** — each `Article` holds an `images: string[]` array. News cards auto-advance through photos at a random per-card cadence (2–5 s) with a slide-in transition; users can also navigate manually via arrow buttons or tap the progress dashes.
- **Responsive design** — mobile-first, fully responsive across all breakpoints. Footer link groups display in a 2-column grid on mobile, with legal policy links intentionally omitted.
- **GSAP animations** — hero word-mask reveals, scroll-triggered section entrances, staggered listing cards, filter entrances, smooth carousel transitions, pinned horizontal scroll, brand-statement word-mask reveal, and custom about-page interactions.
- **Lenis smooth scrolling** — global smooth-scroll layer integrated with ScrollTrigger refreshes.
- **Reference-led About page** — cinematic sticky image hero, scroll-darkened intro, scroll-revealed brand statement, full-viewport parallax imagery, timeline story cards, GSAP-driven mosaic rows, interactive certificates, mood selector, and a one-viewport closing link/wordmark screen.
- **Unified listing pages** — Products, News, and Vacancies share the same title/filter structure, selected-filter button treatment, and GSAP-managed card reveal behavior.
- **Reference-style header** — transparent over hero imagery, hidden background at the top of hero pages, and a blurred panel/bottom stroke that transitions in on scroll. The About page keeps the same visual treatment while hiding on scroll down and reappearing on scroll up.
- **Live water gradient** — animated CSS blob gradient on the CTA banner, about-page stats band, and collection panels using layered radial blurs with keyframe drift + pulse animations.
- **Global typography** — site-wide `font-light` / `font-normal` weight system for a clean, editorial feel.

```

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
GMAIL_USER=your@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx
NOREPLY_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
WEBSITE_EMAIL=website@yourdomain.com
```

## Build & Deploy

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

The project is a standard Next.js app and can be deployed to **Vercel**, **Netlify**, or any Node.js hosting environment.

## Quality Checks

Use these commands before committing or deploying:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
```

On Windows PowerShell, if `npm.ps1` is blocked by the execution policy, use the command shim instead:

```powershell
npm.cmd run lint
npm.cmd run build
```

Current validation status:

- ESLint passes without errors or warnings.
- Production build passes with Next.js 16.2.7 and Turbopack.
- ESLint ignores `.claude/**` so local agent worktrees are not checked as project source.
- React hook updates avoid synchronous state writes inside effects where Next.js/React lint rules flag them.
- Latest checked commands: `npm.cmd run lint` and `npm.cmd run build`.

## Brand Colours
