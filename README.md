Official corporate website for **RAHATLYK**, a Turkmen water and beverage company.

## Platform & Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Framework | [Next.js 16](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router, Turbopack) |
| Language | TypeScript |
| Styling | [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/) |
| Animations | [GSAP](https://gsap.com/) + ScrollTrigger |
| Smooth scrolling | [Lenis](https://lenis.darkroom.engineering/) |
| Images | Next.js `<Image>` (optimised) |
| Fonts | Google Fonts via `next/font` |
| Internationalisation | Custom context (`src/lib/i18n/`) — Turkmen, Russian & English |
| Email | Nodemailer + Gmail SMTP (contact & vacancy forms) |

## Features

- **Multi-language support** — Turkmen (`tm`), Russian (`ru`) and English (`en`) with a dropdown language switcher in the Navbar visible at all breakpoints.
- **Full-screen mobile menu** — frosted-glass overlay with large nav links, social icons (Instagram, email), and smooth open/close transitions.
- **Product Catalogue** — filterable grid with category tabs; individual product detail pages with image gallery (prev/next arrows appear only when a product has more than one photo).
- **News / Blog** — filterable by category (Company, Health, Products, Sustainability); featured article banner; individual article pages with sidebar and "More Articles" section. Homepage news section is a full-viewport auto-play infinite carousel.
- **Vacancies** — filterable by department; individual vacancy detail pages with rich job description and "Other Openings" sidebar.
- **Contact & Vacancy forms** — minimalist design (gray-fill inputs, no labels, black submit button); server-side email handling via `/api/contact` and `/api/vacancy` routes; sends a confirmation email to the user and a notification email with CV attachment to the company.
- **URL-driven filtering** — all listing pages (`/products`, `/news`, `/vacancies`) read their active filter from query params (`?category=`, `?department=`) so category links from detail pages deep-link directly to the filtered view.
- **Responsive design** — mobile-first, fully responsive across all breakpoints. Footer link groups display in a 2-column grid on mobile.
- **GSAP animations** — hero word-mask reveals, scroll-triggered section entrances, staggered listing cards, filter entrances, smooth carousel transitions, pinned horizontal scroll, and custom about-page interactions.
- **Lenis smooth scrolling** — global smooth-scroll layer integrated with ScrollTrigger refreshes.
- **Reference-led About page** — cinematic sticky image hero, scroll-darkened intro, scroll-revealed brand statement, full-viewport parallax imagery, timeline story cards, GSAP-driven mosaic rows, interactive certificates, mood selector, and a one-viewport closing link/wordmark screen.
- **Unified listing pages** — Products, News, and Vacancies share the same title/filter structure, selected-filter button treatment, and GSAP-managed card reveal behavior.
- **Reference-style header** — transparent over hero imagery, hidden background at the top of hero pages, and a reference-style blurred panel/bottom stroke on scroll where applicable.
- **Live water gradient** — animated CSS blob gradient on the CTA banner, about-page stats band, and collection panels using layered radial blurs with keyframe drift + pulse animations.
- **Global typography** — site-wide `font-light` / `font-normal` weight system for a clean, editorial feel.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
GMAIL_USER=your@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx
NOREPLY_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
WEBSITE_EMAIL=website@yourdomain.com
```

## Build & Deploy

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

The project is a standard Next.js app and can be deployed to **Vercel**, **Netlify**, or any Node.js hosting environment.

## Quality Checks

Use these commands before committing or deploying:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
```

On Windows PowerShell, if `npm.ps1` is blocked by the execution policy, use the command shim instead:

```powershell
npm.cmd run lint
npm.cmd run build
```

Current validation status:

- ESLint passes without errors or warnings.
- Production build passes with Next.js 16.2.7 and Turbopack.
- ESLint ignores `.claude/**` so local agent worktrees are not checked as project source.
- React hook updates avoid synchronous state writes inside effects where Next.js/React lint rules flag them.
- Latest checked commands: `npm.cmd run lint` and `npm.cmd run build`.

## Brand Colours
